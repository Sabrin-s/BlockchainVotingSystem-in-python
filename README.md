It demonstrates how blockchain ensures secure, transparent, and tamper-proof voting.
The system allows voters to cast their votes digitally while ensuring that votes cannot be altered, duplicated, or deleted.

Python programming for the backend logic.
Blockchain data structure to store votes securely in blocks.
